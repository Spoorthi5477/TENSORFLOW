# TENSORFLOW
TensorFlow Extended: Image Classification and Object Detection Models with Google Colab


Overview
This project demonstrates how to create and train image classification and object detection models using TensorFlow, Google Colab, and custom datasets. The models are trained using a dataset created with `labelImg`, and the training process is carried out in Google Colab.

Objectives
- Image Classification**: Classify images into different categories based on their content.
- Object Detection**: Detect and label objects within images.

Project Structure
- `dataset/`: Contains the labelled images used for training and validation.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for training both models.
- `models/`: Trained TensorFlow Lite models (`.tflite` files).
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for setting up and running the models.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.

Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tensorflow-extended.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Follow the instructions in the notebooks to train the models.
